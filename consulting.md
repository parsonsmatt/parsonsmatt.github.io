So you enjoy my blogposts or open source work, and you'd like some help with some Haskell.
I'm available for consulting.
I can help in a variety of ways:

# Architecture

Are you unsure how to structure your Haskell application on a high level?
I can provide guidance on this, offering advice and experience on library selection and trade-offs between various approaches.

# Implementation

Do you have a Haskell application that you need an extra hand on?
I can help build and specify the application with you at a rapid development pace.

# Tutoring

Do you want to learn more about a specific Haskell topic?
I can provide tutoring on a wide variety of things, from fancy type level stuff to low-level performance concerns.

# Documentation

Is there a topic you'd like me to write on?
I can write tutorials, library documentation, and friendly introductions to advanced topics.

# Get in touch!
